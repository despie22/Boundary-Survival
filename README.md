# Boundary-Survival
A simple JavaScript game, developed to show plugins and website design.

How to play:
Open BoudaryStart.html in the FinalProject folder with updated Chrome, Firefox or Safari web browser.
Click the Start button to begin the game, when on a new page click the “move” button to jump to a new part of the map.
After clicking “Move”, read the message and input only one of the directions it tells you to enter, it is not case sensitive so you can enter south or SouTH and it will return the same. It will keep prompting until you give it a correct input or hit cancel. 
Hitting cancel on the prompt will still count as a move, so be careful!
On firefox browser don’t check prevent this page from creating additional dialogs and type in the wrong input during the second prompt on Slim Lake, this will cause you to lose a move, and need to click move again.
Try and reach one of the four outfitters not all are guaranteed, and some moves are will always be fatal!
Clicking back one page will send you back to the last lake, but after Rice Lake or Big Rice lake it will mess up your move counter and you will run out of days! Moving forward and back pages is cheating and could cause you to enter DaysPerish page!
When you reach DaysPerish.html you cannot go back a page and must hit retry or close the page to continue.
